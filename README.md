# Simple Education System
**In order to see the last version of the code, please switch to brach "version1.2_studentComplete"**

The project contains both the client and server side. Angular is used for frontend part and it is runned on node.js during development. REST API is developed on Apache server using PHP. The project might not work properly when you clone the repo if you don't have the proper apache server setup (XAMPP might be a good solution since it is lightweight and cross-platform). MySQL is used as the database.

The system has three type of users. Student, instructor & teaching assistant. Implementation of teaching assistant is missing.
