<!-- Fixed navigation bar. The elements comes before router outlet are refreshed  -->
<!-- once. However, if the components are listed after router outlet, every time a navigation -->
<!-- occurs, the entire page is refreshed. Therefore, the navBar is kept between a div element -->
<!-- later to be displayed and hid throughout the program. -->
